WATER QUALITY ANALYSIS - OFFICIAL BCG CLASSIFICATION REPORT
================================================================================

Generated on: 2025-07-07 02:00:33

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------
This analysis uses the official BCG (Biological Classification Group)
thresholds for water quality classification. Multiple machine learning
models were trained and evaluated to predict water quality scores.

OFFICIAL BCG CLASSIFICATION THRESHOLDS
--------------------------------------------------
BCG1 - High (0.80-1.00):     Excellent water quality
BCG2 - Good (0.60-0.79):     Good water quality
BCG3 - Moderate (0.40-0.59): Moderate water quality
BCG4 - Poor (0.20-0.39):     Poor water quality
BCG5 - Bad (0.00-0.19):      Bad water quality

DATASET INFORMATION
----------------------------------------
Training samples: 94
Validation samples: 24
Test samples: 47
Features: 4 (TP, EC, DO, TIT)

BEST PERFORMING MODEL: Linear Models
  RMSE: 0.0914
  R²: 0.6943

CHEMICAL PARAMETERS EXPLANATION
---------------------------------------------
TP (Total Phosphorus): Nutrient pollution indicator
  - High values indicate eutrophication risk
  - Affects algae growth and oxygen depletion

EC (Electrical Conductivity): Dissolved salts/minerals
  - Indicates total dissolved solids concentration
  - Affects water taste and agricultural use

DO (Dissolved Oxygen): Critical for aquatic life
  - Essential for fish and aquatic organisms
  - Low levels indicate organic pollution

TIT (Titration/Alkalinity): pH buffering capacity
  - Water's resistance to pH changes
  - Important for ecosystem stability

TEST DATA BCG CLASSIFICATION SUMMARY

CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Water quality assessment based on official BCG thresholds
   provides standardized classification for management decisions.

2. Stations classified as BCG4 (Poor) or BCG5 (Bad) require
   immediate attention and remediation measures.

3. Regular monitoring and model updates recommended to track
   water quality trends and intervention effectiveness.

4. Chemical parameter analysis helps identify specific
   pollution sources and appropriate treatment strategies.
